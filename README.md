## SDK Requirements

Apphud SDK requires minimum iOS 11.2, Xcode 10 and Swift 5.0. 

## Installation

Apphud SDK can be installed via CocoaPods, Swift Package Manager or manually.

##### Install via CocoaPods

Add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'ApphudSDK'
```

> In Objective-C project make sure `use_frameworks!` is added in your Podfile.

And then run in the Terminal:

```ruby
pod install
```
##### Install via SPM (Swift Package Manager)

Add dependecy with the following URL:

```
https://github.com/apphud/ApphudSDK
```

#### Manual Installation

Copy all files in `Source` folder to your project.

## Initialize Apphud SDK

To set up Apphud SDK you will need API Key. [Register](https://docs.apphud.com/getting-started/creating-app) your app in Apphud and get your API key.

```swift
import ApphudSDK

func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
	
  Apphud.start(apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY")

  // the rest of your code
  return true
}

```

> In Objective-C project you should import like this: `#import "ApphudSDK-Swift.h"`

## Integrations

If you want to send subscription events to third party analytics platforms, you will need to [match user IDs](https://docs.apphud.com/getting-started/sdk-integration#set-up-analytics-integrations-ios-part) (in case of Amplitude or Mixpanel). The full list of available integrations is available [here](https://apphud.com/integrations).

## Push Notifications

To handle [push notifications](https://docs.apphud.com/getting-started/push) you need to provide Apphud with device tokens and handle incoming notifications. This is highly recommended in order to use [Rules](https://docs.apphud.com/rules-and-screens/rules) ‚Äì a powerful feature that lets you increase your app revenue by automatically offering a discount to a user at the specified moment.

## Handle Subscriptions

If you have a live app and already implemented subscription purchasing, it is not necessary to rewrite your subscription purchase flow with Apphud methods. Apphud SDK will still automatically track all purchases in your app.

Apphud SDK provides a set of methods to manage subscriptions. All these methods can be used regardless how you purchased the subscription (via Apphud SDK or your existing code).

### Fetch Products

Apphud automatically fetches SKProduct objects upon launch. Products identifiers must be [added](https://docs.apphud.com/getting-started/adding-products) in our dashboard. To get your products call:

```swift
Apphud.products()
```

When products are fetched from the App Store you will also receive a notification from Notification Center along with Apphud delegate method call (use what fits better your needs).

### Make a Purchase

To make a purchase:

```swift
Apphud.purchase(product) { result in
   // handle result
}
```

This method will return an ApphudPurchaseResult object, which contains subscription model with all info about your subscription. ApphudPurchaseResult may also contain transaction, error and nonRenewingPurchase objects in case user purchased non-renewing purchase. See ApphudPurchaseResult.swift and ApphudSubscription.swift files for details.

### Check Subscription Status

```swift
Apphud.hasActiveSubscription()
```

Returns `true` if the user has active subscription. Use this method to determine whether or not to unlock premium functionality to the user. 

### Get Subscription Details

To get subscription object (which contains expiration date, autorenew status, etc.) use the following method: 

```swift
Apphud.subscription()
```

 See `ApphudSubscription.swift` file for details.
 
 ### Check Non-renewing Purchase Status

```swift
let active = Apphud.isNonRenewingPurchaseActive(productIdentifier: "productID")
```

Prints `true` if the user has purchased in-app purchase and it's not refunded. Returns `false` if never purchased or refunded. 
 
 ### Get Non-renewing Purchase Details

To get non-renewing purchases, which contain purchase date, product identifier and cancellation date, use the following method: 

```swift
Apphud.nonRenewingPurchases()
```

Will return array of all non-renewing in-app purchases, user has ever purchased. In-app purchases are sorted by purchase date.

### Restore Purchases

If your app doesn't have a login system, which identifies a premium user by his credentials, then you need a restore mechanism. If you already have a restore purchases mechanism by calling `SKPaymentQueue.default().restoreCompletedTransactions()`, then you have nothing to worry about ‚Äì Apphud SDK will automatically intercept and send latest App Store Receipt to Apphud servers when your restoration is completed. However, better to call our restore method from SDK:

```swift
Apphud.restorePurchases{ subscriptions, purchases, error in 
   // handle here
}
```

Basically it just sends App Store Receipt to Apphud and returns subscriptions in callback (or `nil` if nothing was ever purchased).

## Migrate Existing Subscribers

If you already have a live app with paying users and you want Apphud to track their subscriptions or non-renewing purchases, you should import their App Store receipts into Apphud. Apphud SDK doesn't automatically submit App Store receipts of your existing paying users. Run this code at launch of your app:

```swift
// hasPurchases - is your own boolean value indicating that current user is paying user.
if hasPurchases {
    Apphud.migratePurchasesIfNeeded {_, _, _ in}
}
```

## Determing Eligibility for Introductory or Promotional Offer

You can use Apphud SDK to determine if a user is eligible for an introductory or promotional offer:

```swift
// Checking eligibility for introductory offer
Apphud.checkEligibilityForIntroductoryOffer(product: myProduct) { result in
  if result {
    // User is eligible for introductory offer
  }
}

// Checking eligibility for promotional offer
Apphud.checkEligibilityForPromotionalOffer(product: myProduct) { result in
  if result {
    // User is eligible for promotional offer
  }
}
```

You may also check eligibility for multiple offers at one call: 
`checkEligibilitiesForPromotionalOffers(products: [SKProduct], callback: ApphudEligibilityCallback)` or `checkEligibilitiesForIntroductoryOffers(products: [SKProduct], callback: ApphudEligibilityCallback)`

## Pricing

Apphud is absolutely free unless you make $10K per month. You can check our pricing [here](https://apphud.com/pricing).
