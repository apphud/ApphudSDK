     You should call it only if you purchase products using Apphud SDK, i.e. by using `Apphud.purchase(product)` method. Do not call this method in observer (analytics) mode.
     
     By default, Apphud SDK only finishes transactions, that were started by Apphud SDK, i.e. by calling  any of `Apphud.purchase..()` methods.
    
     However, in rare cases transactions may stay in the queue (for example, if you broke execution until transaction is finished). And these transactions will try to finish at every next app launch or resume. In this case you may see a system alert prompting to enter your Apple ID password or even new purchase flow will not start. To fix this issue, you can add this method.
     
     You may also use this method in production if you don't care about handling pending transactions, for example, downloading Apple hosted content.
