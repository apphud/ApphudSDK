        Returns array of subscriptions that user ever purchased. Empty array means user never purchased a subscription. If you have just one subscription group in your app, you will always receive just one subscription in an array.
     
        This method is called when subscription is purchased or updated (for example, status changed from `trial` to `expired` or `isAutorenewEnabled` changed to `false`). SDK also checks for subscription updates when app becomes active.

        Called when user ID has been changed. Use this if you implement integrations with Analytics services.

        This delegate method is called in 2 cases:
     
        * When Apphud has merged two users into a single user (for example, after user has restored purchases from his another device).
        Merging users is done in the following way: after App Store receipt has been sent to Apphud, server tries to find the same receipt in the database.
        If the same App Store receipt has been found, Apphud merges two users into a single user with two devices and then returns an original userID.
     
        __Note__: Only subscriber devices are mergable. If non-premium user uses the app from two different devices, Apphud won't be able to know that these devices belong to the same user.
     
        * After manual call of `updateUserID(userID : String)` method.

     You must return a callback block which will be called when a payment is finished. If you don't implement this method or return `nil` then a payment will not start; you can also save the product and return `nil` to initiate a payment later by yourself.

        If you don't implement this method, then product identifiers will be fetched from Apphud servers.
     
        Implementing this delegate method gives you more reliabality on fetching products and a little more speed on loading due to skipping Apphud request, but also gives less flexibility because you have to hardcode product identifiers this way.
