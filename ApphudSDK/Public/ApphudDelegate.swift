     Called when there is an update to the user's subscriptions. This includes new purchases, updates to existing subscriptions (e.g., status change from `trial` to `expired`, or change in `isAutorenewEnabled`).

     This method provides an array of `ApphudSubscription` objects representing all subscriptions the user has ever purchased. An empty array indicates the user has never purchased a subscription. In apps with only one subscription group, this array will typically contain only one subscription.

     - parameter subscriptions: An array of `ApphudSubscription` objects reflecting the user's subscription history and status.

     Called when the user's ID in Apphud changes. This is important for maintaining continuity in integrations with analytics services.

     This method is called in two scenarios:
     1. When Apphud merges two user accounts into one. This can happen if a user restores purchases from another device and Apphud identifies the same App Store receipt in its database. In this case, the two accounts are merged, and the original userID is returned.
        - __Note__: Only subscriber devices are mergeable. Non-premium users on multiple devices cannot be merged unless they have a subscription.
     2. After manually calling the `updateUserID(userID: String)` method.

     - parameter userID: The new user ID assigned to the user.
     - Note: For more information on user ID changes and their implications, refer to Apphud's documentation on initialization and user merging: `https://docs.apphud.com/docs/initialization`

Alternatively, you can save the product and return `nil` to initiate the payment later by yourself.
