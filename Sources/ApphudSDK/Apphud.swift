        If the same App Store receipt has been found, Apphud merges two users into a single user with two devices and then returns an original userID. 
     
        __Note__: Only subscriber devices are mergable. If non-premium user uses the app from two different devices, Apphud won't be able to know that these devices belong to the same user.
