        This delegate method is called in 2 cases:
     
        * When Apphud has merged two users into a single user (for example, after user has restored purchases from his another device).
        Merging users is done in the following way: after App Store receipt has been sent to Apphud, server tries to find the same receipt in the database.
        If the same App Store receipt has been found, Apphud merges two users into a single user with two devices and then returns an original userID. 
     
        __Note__: Only subscriber devices are mergable. If non-premium user uses the app from two different devices, Apphud won't be able to know that these devices belong to the same user.
